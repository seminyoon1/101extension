# 101Extension / Go Stone Hider
This is a 101weiqi Extension for tsumego visualization and training (extremely buggy however) for chrome browsers only. It will hide all go stones except the last stone placed on the board so you are forced to get better. I thought about making it so that you will be unable to turn it off... but that probably isn't a good idea.

# To Access while Google is reviewing my chrome extension
Download -> 
go to chrome://extensions/ -> 
Top right turn on Developer Mode -> 
Load unpacked

# Access
Go to a 101weiqi.com site and solve some problems on extreme difficulty!
Press "T" to toggle on/off
Press "R" to reset the overlay
(Resetting is needed if the canvas changes/ dots are not aligned, didn't want to continously check and redraw)

Move branches are saved and so you have to reset the problem first then reset the overlay to try again.

# Help
Uh, submit a pr if you have a time to waste/ are slacking off on doing tsumego and want to improve this
